The [Freecine Translations team](http://freecinetranslations.com/and_us/) can translate any legal documents for law firms, courts, private and public corporations, and international organizations, including legal opinions, court orders, legal evidence, affidavits, any legally binding agreements (employment, sale, lease, software, articles of incorporation), wills, powers of attorney, sale deeds, conveyance deeds, and any legal documents for international organizations (trial judgments and sentences by international criminal courts, statements, resolutions, decisions, administrative judgments, etc.). Francine Le Touzé, the C.E.O of the company, has been highly trained in English to French legal translation through a very demanding 3-year program (800 hours) with [CI3M](http://ci3m.co.uk/legal-translation-course-english-french), Rennes, France and the legal translation Professor Mrs. Véronique Sauron, and works with highly qualified legal translators from around the world.
