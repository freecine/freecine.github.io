The [Freecine Translations team](http://freecinetranslations.com/and_us/) can translate any documents for private corporations, NGOs, governmental institutions and international organizations. Based on 10 years of experience with major institutions, we have a team that can translate from and to any languages, including highly specialized documents for international organizations (appraisal documents, financial proposals, grant requests, protocols, research reports, guides, manuals, etc.), NGOs (public health reports and documentation) and private companies (websites, company brochures, presentations, training supports). Francine is also part of the [OECD](http://www.oecd.org/)’s, [the Global Fund](http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/)’s and [the U.S. Department of State](http://www.state.gov/)’s translation rosters.
