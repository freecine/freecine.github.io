The Freecine Translations team can translate any documents for private corporations, NGOs, governmental institutions and international organizations. Based on a 10-year experience with major institutions (including the World Bank, the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, Population Services International), we have a team which can translate from and to any language, including highly specialized documents for international organizations (appraisal documents, financial proposals, grant requests, protocols, research reports, guides, manuals, etc.), NGOs (public health reports and documentation) and private companies (websites). Francine is also part of the OECDâ€™s and the US State Department translation roster.
