The Freecine Translations team can translate from English into French any legal documents for law firms, courts, private and public corporations, and international organizations, including legal opinions, court orders, legal evidence, affidavits, any legally binding agreements (employment, sale, lease, software, articles of incorporation), wills, powers of attorney, sale deeds, conveyance deeds, and any legal documents for international organizations (trial judgments and sentences by international criminal courts, statements, resolutions, decisions, administrative judgments, etc.). Francine Le Touzé has been highly trained in legal translation through a 3-year very demanding program (800 hours) with CI3M, Rennes, France and the legal translation teacher Véronique Sauron.
